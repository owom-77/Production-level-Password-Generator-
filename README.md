Production-Level Password Generator
This is a production-ready password generator built with React, designed to create strong, customizable passwords. The project follows best practices in React development, ensuring scalability, reusability, and maintainability. Key features include:

Forward Refs: Utilized to manage component references for better performance and flexibility in dynamic scenarios.
Modular Structure: Each component is separated into individual files for a clean, maintainable codebase, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making future updates or additions easier.
Customization Options: Users can select the length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and more to generate a password that suits their needs.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience.
This project serves as an example of clean, production-level React code, using state management, event handling, and styling with Tailwind CSS.
